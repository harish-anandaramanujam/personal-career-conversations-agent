My name is Harish Ananda Ramanujam. I'm a Software Engineer with Viasat. I work on MLOps and Data Engineer projects. I'm from India, but I moved to USA in 2018 for Masters Degree.
I love Japanese and Thai restaurants apart from Indian food. I'm still craving for an authentic Indian food in USA after these many years
